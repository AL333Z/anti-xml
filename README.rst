==================================
Anti-XML: The Non-Violent Solution
==================================

**Documentation and usage can be found at http://anti-xml.org**

Anti-XML is a proposed replacement for the ``scala.xml`` package in
the Scala standard library. The standard package is outdated and
beyond fixing. We need to start over, on solid foundations and
unburdened by backward compatibility. Anti-XML aims for quality in
three major areas:

* **Usability**

  * Leverage powerful ideas like combinators and proper ADTs_
  * Leverage the 2.8 collections library
  * Provide consistent selector behavior
  * Avoid these missteps: ``Node <: NodeSeq <: Seq[Node]``,
    ``MetaData``, ``Atom[String]``

* **Reliability**

  * Use immutable data structures (in the API and under the hood too)
  * Avoid bugs and race conditions
  * Provide a proper ``equals``
  
* **Performance**

  * Lower memory usage (`Novell Vibe`_ once had a 16 MB chunk of XML
    use 250 MB of heap!)
  * Provide efficient selectors

We are exploring `many ideas`_ for this project. It will be
interesting to see where things go!

Usage
=====

The Maven artifact descriptor for the latest *stable* version of
Anti-XML is as follows: ``com.codecommit:anti-xml_2.8.1:0.2``.  We also regularly
push ``-SNAPSHOT`` releases to the Scala-Tools_ "snapshots" repository, for all
five of you who like to live dangerously.  You should be able to use this
descriptor to easily add Anti-XML as a dependency to any project with a
Maven-compatible build system (Maven, Buildr, SBT, Gradle, Ivy, etc). The stable
artifacts themselves are hosted in the Scala-Tools_ "releases" repository.  For
reference, here are a few copy/paste snippets you can use for some of the common
build systems.

**SBT**::
  
    val antiXML = "com.codecommit" %% "anti-xml" % "0.2"
  
**Buildr**::
  
    compile.with "com.codecommit:anti-xml_#{Scala.version}:jar:0.2"
  
**Maven2**::
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.codecommit</groupId>
      <artifactId>anti-xml_2.8.1</artifactId>
      <version>0.2</version>
    </dependency>
    
  
Supported Versions of Scala
---------------------------

Anti-XML is cross-built_ for the following Scala versions:

* **2.9.1**
* **2.9.0-1**
* **2.9.0**

Support for the 2.8.x stream is being dropped in version 0.3.  It is believed
that 2.9.x has had sufficient time to mature and there is very little reason to
continue to work with 2.8.1.  However, if there is demand for a 2.8.1 (or 2.8.0)
compatible release, open an issue and I will manually build a JAR for the appropriate
version.

Contributing
============

Contributions are most welcome!  Fork, hack, request pull, rinse and repeat.  If
you're looking for things to work on, I would check the `issue tracker`_ or the
`official TODO list`_.  However, before you get started, be sure to read the
information in CONTRIBUTING.rst_.  It offers some basic code guidelines (don't
worry, curly braces aren't a religious issue here) and explains the legal
mumbo-jumbo involved in contributing.
