Usage
=====

The Maven artifact descriptor for the latest *stable* version of
Anti-XML is as follows: ``com.codecommit:anti-xml_2.8.1:0.2``.  We also regularly
push ``-SNAPSHOT`` releases to the Scala-Tools_ "snapshots" repository, for all
five of you who like to live dangerously.  You should be able to use this
descriptor to easily add Anti-XML as a dependency to any project with a
Maven-compatible build system (Maven, Buildr, SBT, Gradle, Ivy, etc). The stable
artifacts themselves are hosted in the Scala-Tools "releases" repository.  For
reference, here are a few copy/paste snippets you can use for some of the common
build systems.

**SBT**::
  
    val antiXML = "com.codecommit" %% "anti-xml" % "0.2"
  
**Buildr**::
  
    compile.with "com.codecommit:anti-xml_#{Scala.version}:jar:0.2"
  
**Maven2**::
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.codecommit</groupId>
      <artifactId>anti-xml_2.8.1</artifactId>
      <version>0.2</version>
    </dependency>
    
  
Supported Versions of Scala
===========================

Anti-XML is cross-built_ for the following Scala versions:

* **2.9.1**
* **2.9.0-1**
* **2.9.0**
* **2.8.1**

While it is theoretically possible to add support for 2.8.0, we have no plans to
do so at this time.  The reason being that Specs2_ – the testing framework used
by Anti-XML – has not been cross-built for 2.8.0.  Additionally, ScalaCheck_ has
not updated its 2.8.0 cross-build in several months.  All that combined with the
fact that 2.8.1 is a nearly-completely backwards compatible update with 2.8.0 has
led to the conclusion that cross-building for 2.8.0 just isn't worth the effort.
