=====
Usage
=====

The Maven artifact descriptor for the latest *stable* version of
Anti-XML is as follows: ``com.codecommit:anti-xml_2.8.1:0.3``.  We also regularly
push ``-SNAPSHOT`` releases to the `Scala-Tools`_ "snapshots" repository, for all
five of you who like to live dangerously.  You should be able to use this
descriptor to easily add Anti-XML as a dependency to any project with a
Maven-compatible build system (Maven, Buildr, SBT, Gradle, Ivy, etc). The stable
artifacts themselves are hosted in the Scala-Tools "releases" repository.  For
reference, here are a few copy/paste snippets you can use for some of the common
build systems.

**SBT**::
  
    val antiXML = "com.codecommit" %% "anti-xml" % "0.3"
  
**Buildr**::
  
    compile.with "com.codecommit:anti-xml_#{Scala.version}:jar:0.3"
  
**Maven2**::
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.codecommit</groupId>
      <artifactId>anti-xml_${scala.version}</artifactId>
      <version>0.3</version>
    </dependency>
